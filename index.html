    <br/>
When I first joined Fashol.com as a software engineer, I had no idea how deeply this company would become a part of my story. Every day brought new lessons, challenges, and moments that helped shape who I am today — not just as a developer, but as a person.
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="beg"> The Beginning of My Professional Journey<br/></span>
Starting out at Fashol was both exciting and overwhelming. I stepped into the world of real-life software development, daily standups, sprint planning, and debugging sessions. But what stood out the most was the warmth and support from my team — a group of people who made work feel like home.

Fashol wasn’t just a place to write code. It was where I learned how to think about product, user experience, scalability, and teamwork. I grew with the company — not just technically, but emotionally and professionally. Every success, every bug fixed, and every team celebration was a moment of growth.

<span class="gel">A Gallery of Memories<br/></span>
From spontaneous team lunches to late-night deployments, and from silly coffee breaks to intense brainstorming sessions — Fashol gave me memories that I’ll carry forever. Those weren’t just colleagues. They were friends, mentors, and family.
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="love">Gratitude & Love</span>
<br/>
A huge part of who I am today comes from my time at Fashol. I’m endlessly grateful for the people I worked with, the culture that nurtured me, and the projects that challenged me.
<br/>
So yes, proudly I say — "Once a Fasholian, always a Fasholian."

<br/>
Some workplaces are just offices. But some become home.
<br/>
Fashol will always be that place for me. </p></div>
